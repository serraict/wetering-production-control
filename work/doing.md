## âœ… Optimize Dockerfile for Faster Deployments with Multi-stage Builds

Restructured the Dockerfile to use multi-stage builds for better optimization when pulling updates. This approach is specifically designed for workflows using `docker compose pull`, separating dependencies from code to speed up deployments when only Python code changes.

### Implemented Changes

1. Created a three-stage Dockerfile:
   - **Base stage**: Contains system dependencies
   - **Dependencies stage**: Installs Python packages
   - **Final stage**: Combines base, dependencies, and application code

2. Added comprehensive documentation in `scripts/docker_build_optimization.md` explaining:
   - How to leverage the multi-stage build
   - Development workflow
   - Production deployment optimization
   - CI/CD integration recommendations

3. Updated CHANGELOG.md with version 0.1.14 entry

### Benefits
- Dependencies layer is built and cached separately
- Only code changes trigger rebuilds of the final stage
- Faster pulls when only Python code has changed
- Full rebuilds only happen when dependencies change

### Next Steps
- Implement the recommended CI/CD pipeline changes
- Monitor deployment times to verify optimization
