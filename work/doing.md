## Goal: Labels are ready for the next six months

In three months, the old http://pc.serra.vine urls will be discontinued, and we should use the new https://pv.[environment].serraict.me url scheme.
With large texts, label text might overflow, which leads to missing information on the main label.

## Actions

### Use the new url scheme

### Fix the label overflow issue

### Fix the CI build

It now fails because it is not connected to a db.
Missing integration test markers?
