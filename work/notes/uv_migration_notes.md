# UV Migration Notes

## Project: Switch to uv package manager

**Date Started:** 6 August 2025

## Objective

Migrate from pip to uv for dependency management to improve installation speed and reproducibility.

## Current Environment

- Python: 3.12.2 (via pyenv)
- uv version: 0.5.12
- Virtual environment: `/Users/marijn/dev/serraict/customers/wetering/production_control/venv`
- uv.lock exists: âœ… (2373 lines)

## Baseline Measurements

### Current Setup Analysis

- Makefile `update` target uses: `pip install --upgrade pip build` + `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` + `pip install -e .`
- CI workflow uses: `make update`
- Dependencies split between:
  - `pyproject.toml` (runtime deps)
  - `requirements-dev.txt` (dev deps)
  - `uv.lock` (lockfile, up-to-date)

### Performance Baseline

**Environment:**

- Clean virtual environment in `/tmp/test_venv_pip`
- Network: Good connection
- Test date: 6 August 2025

**Pip Installation Metrics (BASELINE):**
**Pip Installation Metrics (BASELINE):**

- [x] Pip clean install time: **30.249 seconds** âœ…
- [x] Pip cached install time: **22.273 seconds** âœ… (26% faster with cache)
- [x] Current dependency count: ~52 packages installed (dev deps) + ~64 packages total (including runtime)
- [x] Current wheel cache behavior: Most packages cached from previous installs, significant speed improvement

**uv Installation Metrics:**

- [x] uv clean install time (cache cleared): **3.96 seconds** âœ…
- [x] Performance improvement: **7.6x faster** than pip (30.2s â†’ 3.96s) ðŸš€
- [x] All 82 packages installed successfully
- [x] uv creates virtual environment at `.venv` automatically
- [x] Command used: `uv sync --frozen` (respects lockfile, no modifications)

## Implementation Notes

### Observations

- Tests currently pass: 154 passed, 1 skipped (83% coverage)
- CI is passing (not failing as originally thought in backlog)
- Virtual environment is properly set up and being used
- **uv provides massive speed improvement even with cold cache**
- uv.lock file is comprehensive (2373 lines) and well-maintained

### Next Steps

1. âœ… Verified uv sync performance vs pip baseline
1. âœ… Test that applications still work with uv-installed dependencies
1. âœ… Update makefile targets to use uv sync instead of pip install
1. âœ… Update CI workflow to use uv
1. Test CI workflow passes
1. Update documentation to reflect new dependency management approach

### Implementation Details

**Makefile Changes:**

- `bootstrap`: Changed from `python -m venv venv` to `uv venv` (creates `.venv` directory)
- `update`: Changed from pip-based installation to `uv sync --frozen && uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
- Used `--frozen` flag to ensure reproducible builds (same behavior in dev and CI)
- Removed redundant `update-frozen` target for consistency

**CI Workflow Changes:**

- Added `astral-sh/setup-uv@v4` action with caching enabled
- Kept existing `make update` call (now uses uv internally)
- No other workflow files needed changes

**Key Decisions:**

- Use `--frozen` everywhere for consistency and safety
- Dependency updates require explicit `make lock` first
- Maintain dev dependencies in requirements-dev.txt for now

## Issues & Decisions

### Questions to Resolve

- Should we keep `requirements-dev.txt` or migrate fully to pyproject.toml?
- How to handle backwards compatibility during transition?
- CI runner compatibility with uv installation?
