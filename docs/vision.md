# Product vision

The production control app helps *users* at Wetering Potlilium to track the production of potted lilies.

## Why

This tracking information will help to:

- predict when lots of plants will become available to sell
- track what costs have been incurred to grow the plants
- predict what the available production capacity will be

## Target users

Growers (PR, Q) who monitor the crop and guide production operations in the greenhouse.
Growers will access the system through a web interface on their desktop or cell phone.

## Context

Production schedule and the location registration information are available through Serra Vine.
