# Template review

Here we list our experiences using the cookiecutter-vine-app template.
These notes will be used to improve the template for future projects.

## Experiences

venvg was ignored intead of venv

.python-version was missing, so wrong venv was created. Maybe do an assertion in the make bootstrap file

## Advice

In general, do a git log on the template files to see what has changed and why.
