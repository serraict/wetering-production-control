# Investigation: Styling Specific Date Values in NiceGUI Tables

## Context

We attempted to style specific date values (00w01-1) in gray color within a NiceGUI table component that wraps Quasar's QTable.

## Attempted Approaches

### 1. Column Classes Property

- Added "classes" property to date columns
- Result: Applied to all date cells, not just specific values
- Learning: Column-level styling affects all cells in the column

### 2. HTML Injection via Format Function

- Tried to inject HTML with styled spans in the format function
- Result: HTML was escaped and displayed as raw text
- Learning: Table escapes HTML content for security

### 3. Custom Cell Slots

- Added slots for date columns with conditional styling
- Result: Broke the default cell rendering, cells became empty
- Learning: Slots need to maintain the table's default rendering behavior

### 4. Quasar Q-Badge Component

- Attempted to use q-badge for styling as shown in docs example
- Result: Disrupted table layout and cell formatting
- Learning: Q-badge changes cell structure too drastically

### 5. Cell Class Function

- Used cell-class property with conditional function
- Result: No visible effect
- Learning: Cell class binding might not work as expected in NiceGUI wrapper

### 6. Column Class Binding

- Tried Vue-style class binding on column level
- Result: No visible effect
- Learning: Some Quasar features might not be fully exposed through NiceGUI

## Key Learnings

1. **Component Architecture**

   - NiceGUI wraps Quasar's QTable
   - Some Quasar features may not be directly accessible
   - HTML content is escaped for security

1. **Date Handling**

   - Dates are formatted before reaching the table
   - Format pattern: "%gw%V-%u" produces strings like "24w46-3"
   - Formatting happens in both table_utils.py and models.py

1. **Styling Limitations**

   - Column-level styling is too broad
   - Cell-level styling is challenging
   - Default cell rendering must be preserved
   - HTML injection is not possible

## Recommendations

1. Consider alternative approaches:

   - Handle styling at the data level before it reaches the table
   - Use a different component that allows more styling control
   - Implement custom table component if fine-grained styling is crucial

1. Document limitations:

   - NiceGUI table component may not support all styling scenarios
   - Some Quasar features might need direct Vue.js implementation

## Next Steps

Further investigation might explore:

1. Direct Quasar QTable implementation without NiceGUI wrapper
1. Pre-processing data to include styling information
1. Custom table component development if styling requirements are essential
