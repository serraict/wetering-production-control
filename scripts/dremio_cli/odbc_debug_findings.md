# ODBC Debug Findings

## Root Cause Identified

We've identified the root cause of the ODBC driver issues:

1. The system is running on Apple Silicon (arm64 architecture)
2. According to Dremio documentation, "The Arrow Flight SQL ODBC driver is not supported on the Apple M1 architecture"

This explains why we're encountering the error:
```
[01000][unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can't open lib '/Library/Dremio/ODBC/lib/libarrow-flight-sql-odbc.dylib' : file not found
```

Even though the file exists, it can't be loaded properly because it's not compatible with the arm64 architecture.

## Recommendation

Given this limitation, we recommend:

1. Abandon the ISQL/ODBC approach for Apple Silicon machines
2. Use the Python script approach (dremio_query.py) as the primary solution
3. Update our documentation to note this limitation

## Next Steps

1. Update the README.md to document this limitation
2. Focus on enhancing the Python script approach
3. Create example queries for the Python script
4. Consider creating a more user-friendly wrapper around the Python script
